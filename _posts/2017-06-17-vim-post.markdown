# VIM!

This is my first post created using vim. Trying to get used to using it again. Will most likely be using it as my text editor. I really like the folding feature that I got from a plugin. It is a little buggy right now but it is pretty cool overall. I could always deactivate it if I don't like it.

Also using the Goyo plugin to center the text and have a nicer format overall.
