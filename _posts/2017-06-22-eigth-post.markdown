# SAME SAME

Today I worked on pretty much the same stuff as yesterday, except I spent way less time on Documentation, I didn't do any API stuff today, and I dove a little bit deeper in to sketch and found out about something called Marvel. I get a bit of anxiety with all the new tools popping up so I need to be good about choosing my tools and sticking to them. I've been good about using Vim exclusively to write posts, so theres that...

I have to go get ready for a 5v5 Australian rules soccer game. 

## Peace y'all!
