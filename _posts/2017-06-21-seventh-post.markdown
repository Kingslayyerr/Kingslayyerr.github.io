# PAPA BLESS
![Ethan](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dga7qs9VQAI_pkT.jpg)

## Today I spent the day doing:



##

- Swift Programming

Working with logic and control flow statements, getting used to enumerations, tuples, and switch statements in the swift syntax.

- iOS Xcode work

Working on an app that uses cocoapods to make web requests and consumes a weather service API. Alamofire takes care of all of that, it takes the
place of NSURLSessions. This app teaches important key concepts like Data Modeling, working with constraints and stackviews, and parsing JSON data with
Alamo.

- My own personal project

The next iteration of my project, I reached a roadblock on the first version, with this one I will just work on the functionality and the design seperately.
I want to keep the functionality as barebones as possible, there is no point in making it pretty if it doesn't work!

- Sketch

Switched gears a little bit and started working with sketch to learn design, it is the equivalent of CSS and HTML in mobile dev (Mac exclusive).

- API modeling

Still trying to decide which framework to build a light and nimble API in, right now its between Go, Node.js, and Django rest framework.

- Overwatch Break

Had to pawn some noobs for a bit, nothing more satisfying than going Mercy hunting with Winston =)

- Documentation

Worked on making API calls to Eventbrite and displaying the data I want using JQuery and HTML. Learned some more about endpoint documentation and how important
tables are (Still don't know how to make those nifty tables).

- Jekyll

Still need to learn more about manipulating Jekyll and changing things up on the templates.

## Thats all folks!
