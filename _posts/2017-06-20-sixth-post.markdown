# API's:

I have shifted focus from functionality/lifestyle  apps into mobile apps that consume API's and make web requests.

I still have a fairly simple app that I want to finish, but I have put it off for so long that I sort of dread starting it up again.
It will be a good way to solidify the things I initially learned from building it. It will also be really useful to me as a developer.
