## Transparency:

This is sort of a practice post to myself, just to get myself in the routine of posting. It is also a note to myself, to remind me to include my failed personal projects on my portfolio in a "recycle bin" of sorts, and to also include a little excerpt of what I learned from each one. A failed personal project is a chance to learn to be honest with oneself, it teaches the concept of pivoting, and more importantly, when it is the correct time to do so. There is still a lot learned from these projects, it is a good talking point, it forces to ask the question "what would I do differently?" and apply that to new projects.
