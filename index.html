            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I have worked as an Instructional Designer / Technical Writer for CraneMorley and SpaceX. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            I am open to taking on freelance Instructional Design and Technical Writing projects.

          <h4>Intro</h4>
          <p>Hello! My name is Christian, I consider myself a generalist in all things relating to SaaS (Software as a service). I can program web and mobile applications, design user-interfaces, hi-fi prototypes, write concise, user friendly documentation, and create + edit instructional design courses for end users and stakeholders. My biggest strengths however, are my adaptability, curiosity, and can-do attitude. <!-- I learned to program on my own through hard work, persistence, and dedication. I started off learning the basics of <em style="color:#46c4ec;">HTML, CSS</em> and <em style="color:#46c4ec;">Javascript</em> then moved on to using more complex Libraries and Frameworks like <em style="color:#46c4ec;">React</em>, <em style="color:#46c4ec;">Redux</em> and <em style="color:#46c4ec;">Node</em>. -->
         <!--  I have taken a Systemic approach to my skills and education, I believe in breadth first then depth, to be an effective specialist you must at one point be a generalist. -->
          </p>
          <h4>Education</h4>
            <p> My <em style="color:#46c4ec;">Special Emphasis major</em> and <em style="color:#46c4ec;">Computer Science minor</em> at <em style="color:#46c4ec;">CSULB</em> gave
              me the flexibility to design a unique major, through which I was able to take the best
              <em style="color:#46c4ec;">Computer Science</em>, <em style="color:#46c4ec;">UX Design</em>, <em style="color:#46c4ec;">Web Design</em>, <em style="color:#46c4ec;">English</em> and <em style="color:#46c4ec;">Human Factors</em> courses that my university had to offer. <!-- This gave me an extremely unique college experience where I got to work and interact with people from many different majors on a regular basis. --> <!-- I got to see the pros and cons of the Engineering, Art, English, Business and Psychology(Human Factors) departments. I took away so much from my time at CSULB and it ultimately made me what I consider to be a well-rounded individual. --></p>
          <h4>Misc</h4>
          <p> I enjoy listening to comedic podcasts, playing team sports, participating in video-game raids that require perfect synchronized teamwork and communication, participating in hackathons, or anything that involves working together as a team to reach mutual success and victory! üèÜ </p>
          <!-- <h4>Social Anxiety</h4> -->
          <!-- <p>Transparency is important, and this is my truth. Social Anxiety has played a significant role in my life.  It has acted as a double edged sword and a catalyst of sorts. It ultimately made me a well-rounded person who has a deep empathy for all. I love helping others and believe in the capacity for humans to change and to transmute a negative circumstance into a positive one. It is thanks to the isolation that Social Anxiety provided me, that
            I was able to sit in my room and focus on improving myself by reading voraciously and learning auto-didactively.</p> -->

      <h2>AGILE INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN</h2>
      <p>My process to developing e-learning courses places a huge emphasis on initial Agile Design Sprints and excellent communication between SME's, designers, technical writers, end-users and stakeholders.
      I firmly believe that a product is only as good as its overall User Experience, execution and design allow it to be.</p>
